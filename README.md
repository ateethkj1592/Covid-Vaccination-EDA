# Covid-Vaccination-EDA


This repository contains the code and resources for a COVID Vaccination Analysis Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project. The project aims to analyze various aspects of COVID-19 vaccination using publicly available data.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into the following folders:

### 1. Covid Analysis

The "Covid Analysis" folder contains Jupyter Notebook files (.ipynb) that contain the code and documentation for the EDA process. These notebooks include the data preprocessing steps, exploratory data analysis techniques, and statistical analysis performed on the COVID-19 vaccination dataset. They serve as a comprehensive record of the analysis workflow, enabling others to reproduce and build upon the findings.


### 2.  Dataset 

The "Dataset" folder contains all the datasets collected for this project. This includes both covid disease and vaccination dataset. Our world data is one of the important datasets considered for this project along with some other datasets present in the folder.

### 3.  Images

The "Images" folder contains all the graphical outputs, charts, graphs, and visualizations generated during the analysis. These images provide a visual representation of the findings and insights derived from the data. They are essential for understanding the trends, patterns, and relationships uncovered through the EDA process.

### 4. Research Papers and Articles

This folder contains the research papers and articles that were referred to during the project. It serves as a repository of the relevant literature and background information on COVID-19 vaccination. These resources have provided valuable insights and context for the analysis performed in this project.



Please refer to the respective folders for further details and resources related to the COVID Vaccination Analysis EDA project.
