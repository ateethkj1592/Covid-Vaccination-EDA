                                      /// MODERNA VACCINE REPORT///
In March 2020, the Phase I human trial of mRNA-1273 began in partnership with the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

in March would be between 6.8°C and 16.6°C, with exceptional possible peaks as low as -49°C and high as 37°C as observed in previous years.
In April, May, June, September and October, you will avoid the harsh winters that have temperatures reaching down to -20 ° C, and also the hot summers in some areas.
 REASON:-  While the Moderna vaccine doesn’t demand as deep a freeze—the requisite negative 4 degrees Fahrenheit is comparable to a standard home freezer—both must be administered in two doses a month apart, a logistical hurdle not uncommon but certainly not ideal in a quest for worldwide inoculation.
                                    ////PFIZER///
To remain stable, the Pfizer vaccine must be stored in specialized freezers kept at an ultra-low temperature of negative 94 degrees Fahrenheit. Such storage units are manufactured at a select few “freezer farms” and priced at $10,000 to $15,000 apiece. 

In other words, Pfizer and Moderna have created a Lamborghini when what most countries really need is a Toyota—a vaccine that can be manufactured, stored, and administered simply and cheaply, preferably via existing distribution channels.

efficacy of the vaccine is 76.0% at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 beginning at 22 days following the first dose, and 81.3% after the second dose

Oxford Astrazenica is  18 times cheaper than pfizer.

Vaccine with Single dose effectivess:
    The first dose of the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine was associated with a vaccine effect of 94% for COVID-19-related hospitalisation at 28–34 days post-vaccination. Combined results (all vaccinated participants, whether Pfizer–BioNTech or Oxford–AstraZeneca) showed a significant vaccine effect for prevention of COVID-19-related hospitalisation, which was comparable when restricting the analysis to those aged ≥80 years (81%). The majority of the participants over the age of 65 were given the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine.

Effectiveness
A vaccine is generally considered effective if the estimate is ≥50% with a >30% lower limit of the 95% confidence interval.[27] Effectiveness is generally expected to slowly decrease over time
